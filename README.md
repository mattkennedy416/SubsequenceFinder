The core algorithms of this package are based on the highly optimized UCR Suite, with the following features added:
 - algorithms will track and return all locations which are within some specified error, not just the best subsegment
 - bindings to a python class, SubsequenceFinder()

####Example of Use:

'''python
import SubsequenceFinder as sf
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(1200000,)
query = data[1000:1100]

a = sf.SubsequenceFinder()

locs, dists = a.search(query, data, distanceLimit=5, sizeOfWarpingWindow=0.05)
'''
